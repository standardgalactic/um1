You will need a python 3 environment.
You may need two import the packages requests and colorama

We recommend conda from https://anaconda.org
but if you are using pip, that should work too
If you do not yet have a python3 environment then you can create one using

```bash
conda create -n py3 python=3
conda activate py3
conda install requests colorama
```
To run the tests you can now type 

```bash
python3 f.py
```
